This is the official implementation of our paper [MOVE: Harmless and Robust Model Ownership Verification via Embedded External Features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.02820.pdf), which is accepted by IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), 2025. This work is a journal extension of our preliminary [conference paper (AAAI'22)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356717751_Defending_against_Model_Stealing_via_Verifying_Embedded_External_Features). This research project is developed based on Python 3 and Pytorch, created by [Yiming Li](https://liyiming.tech/) and [Linghui Zhu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=mLzDZRoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).

The codes will be released very soon. Please refer to the [codes](https://github.com/zlh-thu/StealingVerification) of implementing our defense under the white-box setting (contained in our conference version) for some insights.
